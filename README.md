## Introduction

Welcome to the CNN Toolbox, a collection of three independent projects developed in Python using TensorFlow. This repository showcases cutting-edge applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the fields of image classification, image segmentation, and visual query answering. Each project provides valuable insights and practical implementations using state-of-the-art techniques (bear in mind the project was developed in 2021, we know reaserch progresses at an extremely high pace!).

## Project Structure

The CNN Toolbox consists of the following projects:

1. **Multiclass Image Classification:** This project focuses on achieving accurate classification of images into multiple classes. Transfer learning techniques are predominantly utilized to leverage pre-trained CNN models and achieve exceptional classification performance.

2. **Image Segmentation:** The Image Segmentation project employs a patch-based mechanism with U-Net, a popular architecture for semantic segmentation. By dividing images into smaller patches and predicting their classes, precise image segmentation results are obtained.

3. **Visual Query Answering (VQA):** The VQA project combines an image feature extractor with an attention mechanism to enable answering queries related to visual content. This project enhances the ability of CNNs to comprehend and interpret visual information.

For each project, code versions compatible with both Windows/Linux and OSX operating systems are provided, ensuring ease of use across different platforms.
